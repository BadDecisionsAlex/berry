# Jump Statements

Berry provides two jump statements, the `break` statement and the `continue` statement.

## break statement

使用break语句可以跳出最近一层的while或者for语句。break语句只能在循环中使用并且不能跨越函数。
Use the `break` statement to leave the nearest `while` or `for` statement. A `break` statement can only be used in a loop and cannot span functions.

## continue statement

The `continue` statement can terminate an iteration of the nearest `while` or `for` statement and immediately start the next iteration. A `continue` statement can only be used in a loop and cannot span functions.
